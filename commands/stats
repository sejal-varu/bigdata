Supervised ML
: Regression (Price of house, weight of plant) Single output (continuous numeric variables)
: CLassification (Yes/NO)


Un supervised:
Just analysis / grouping / (not intrested in orrect or predictive output) Just cluster or put together similar types 


Semi supervised:
Seggregate + outputs something
(Un supervised) + (Supervised)


Reinforcements
Eg. CHess GO netfilx series
Learn from experiences, self leariing, takes time to learn



Statistics:
Type -1 : Descriptive stats:
Mean avegare value
Median : Central tendancy
Mode For categoriacal data

Spreads:
Percentile 25th 5th range
Interquartile range
outliers in data
Box plot in graph basis of percentile
Box plot relation with histogram
Variance Std deviation
Box and whiskers
Skewed distribution


co relation
co releration co efficient
co relation metrics heatmaps

Spurious co relation examples


Variables:
Continous vraiables 
- Can be any value betweeek 0 to infinite
- Non negative
Problen type : Regression

Discreet variable:
Eg. number of steps(1 2 3 4....infinite ) but cannot be 1.2(decimal) OR negative
It has equal distance between each variable 2.2 2.4 2.6 is also discreet as 0.2 is equal distance
Problen type: Depends on problem. Use regression problen and if outcomes is decimal can do ceil floor or round on those output

Categorical variable:
Eg State in India (restricted only to 29 states cannot be out of it)
Can be discreet as 1 to 29
Problen type: Classification

Normal Disrtribution
